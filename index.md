 I am a first year computer science major here at Cal State Fullerton planning to graduate in the year 2028

 #Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

 Lab #1
I enjoyed Lab 1 because since it was the introductory assignment it was really easy to do and very straightforward, 
it also gave me a understanding of how we were going to keep on functioning from here on forward with our assignments. 
Not to mention that I learned how to display a message on the terminal so that the user receives it every time they log in.

Lab #11, Part-2
I enjoyed lab 11 part-2 because although it was a simple code,
it still was difficult trying to use the included files in order to set up a little guessing game where the user has 4 tries to guess.Seeing how typing the wrong return function can really change a lot of the expected output.
My favorite part was learning how to use simple line arguments more efficiently since most of the code was short constructors or functions.

Lab #7, Part-1
I enjoyed lab 7 because we learned how to use bool functions and if statements for the different circumstances they gave us.
This assignment was probably the hardest one for me because of the lack of knowledge I had,
until I was able to receive help and complete I understood the concept of how this parking function worked and
was able to tell you if the parking spot if available to park on or not depending on the time of day, current time 
according to the street rules.
